# Railway Deployment Guide for Django Background Remover

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. **Prepare Your Repository**
Ensure all these files are in your GitHub repository:
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt`
- ‚úÖ `Procfile`

4. Railway will automatically provide `DATABASE_URL`

### 4. **Set Environment Variables**
In Railway project settings ‚Üí Variables, add:

```bash

- Check that `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`
- Ensure database service is running

### **Static Files Not Loading**
- Verify `STATICFILES_STORAGE` in settings.py
